# What everything does:

### 1. Img_mani.py 
Applies a convolution filter to the selected image (I've also uploaded a sample 32 by 32 cat face image you can experiment with). I highly suggest you watch 3b1b's video on convolutions for the same.

### 2. simple_LSTM.py
LSTM with only one cell... I tried to test this on a Tesla stock price dataset I got from Kaggle and it is giving MAPE of around 1.5% (arousing my suspicion, but well).
